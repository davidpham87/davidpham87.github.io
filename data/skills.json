Thanks to my passion, I learned how to prove statements, construct counter-example, improve existing solutions and vulgarizing concepts. It also comes with an additional benefits of learning the Greek alphabet and not being afraid of formulas anymore. The downside is, as most mathematicians, I lost my ability to do simple arithmetic.

In contrast to statistics, we are more interested in the predictive power than parameter inference. The field created its own vocabulary for its application: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement and deep learning. \n \nOne project I really liked in the field was a personal project on artistic style transfer using deep learning. The aim was to combine two pictures, a content and a style picture, to create a new image which would keep the characteristic of both. My aim was to develop a general algorithm which could cope with any style and any content. In order to complete the project, I used Google [TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/) with all the attached requirements (data serialization, cloud storage and computing). ",

For example, in python, I use modules to create namespace and rely on `collections.namedtuple` or dictionaries for data container. This leads to much simpler and readable code.
